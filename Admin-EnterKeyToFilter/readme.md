#Admin - Enter Key to Filter

When in the admin product list or order list views, there are a number of fields which can be used to filter the results - 'product name', 'price', etc.

As of OC 2.0.3.2, when using these filters it is necessary to click on a button to actually filter, though it is easier / faster / intuitive to press the enter button. This modification makes the enter button work on the product and order list pages.
