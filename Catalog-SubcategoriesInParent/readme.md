# Catalog - Subcategory Products listed in Parent Category

OpenCart's default behaviour seems to be that, when viewing a product category, only products directly in that category (and not in child categories) are displayed. 

This probably makes sense in many stores, but it is not the behaviour I was looking for.

This modification changes the behaviour so the category page lists all products in the current and child categories.
