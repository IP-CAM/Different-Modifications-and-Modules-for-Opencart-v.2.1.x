# OpenCart-Modifications

While using OpenCart 2 I have needed to make a number of small modifications to suit my needs.

This repository is intended to be an easy way for me to keep track of these modifications, and I am hopeful it may prove helpful to anyone else in a similar position.

I do not consider myself an experienced OpenCart developer, so please be cautious in testing any modifications you use.
